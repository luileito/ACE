ACE is a system that tailors web UIs to the users' behavior without requiring end-user intervention. 

The webmaster specifies which elements and which CSS properties can be modifiable. Then, when users access the site, the visual appearance of such elements is subtly modified in an unsupervised and incremental manner.
